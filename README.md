How it Works
The AI-based ball game uses Unity's hand tracking technology to detect the user's hand position, direction, and speed. Based on this information, the game updates the ball's position and velocity in real-time to match the player's gestures.

The game loop continuously captures the hand movements, processes the data using the hand tracking system, and updates the ball's position accordingly. The player's performance is evaluated based on their ability to control the ball and achieve specific objectives.
